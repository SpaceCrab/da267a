Callbacks
in computer programming a callback is when a function is is passed as 
a attribute to another function

in C this is done with function pointers 

the volatile keyword 
  it tells the compiler to avoid certain optimisation 
  volatile should be used for Global variables modified by an isr


//*fun sghould be a function pointer that returns void and takes an int
void wrapper (void (*fun)(int)){
  fun(999)
}

interrupts within the ESP32 
  71 peripheral interrupts 
  each processor can handle 32 interrupts

non shared interrupts 
  non shared interuupts can either be edge or level triggered
shared interrupts
  can only be only level interrupts

Expernal peripherals 
  within the ESP32 but outside the xtensa cores 
    both cpus are wired to an interrupt mux
    asllcoating an external interrupt will always 


Internal peripherals
  timers and to software interrupts 

Abstractions for GPIOs
  esp_err_t  gpio_is_register(void(fn*)(void*), void *arg, int)


Timers 
  a timer is a simple counter measuring time by accumulating athe number 
  of clock ticks in a counter register

  operate independently form software execution
  chips use a prescaler to scale down the nr of ticks since clocks are very fast

  a compare register is used to generate an alert ehn the timer 
  reaches a certain value, when the timer matches it may continue or reset

  Typically involved registers
    clock configure register
    timer counter
    Controll register
    Prescale register
    Compare register
    Action register
    Interrupt register

  ESP32
    two hardware timer groups 
    two gp hardware timers 

    PLL_CLK 320 or 480 MHz
    RTC8M_D256_CLK
    RTC_CLK
    APLL_CLK

  Programming timers 
    first of all conf the timer with timer_init()
    passa struct timer_config_t
    divider
    mode 
    counter enable
    alarm enable 
    auto reload
    interrupt type 

    for "slow" timers use esp_timer

time keeping 
  ESP_IDF comes with some handy functions to keep track of time
  based on a 150KHz oscillator 
  
Watchdog
  is a dog that watches

  can be fed within ISR0() or main
  how to feed the watchdog 

  interrupt watchdog timer
  task watchdog timer
